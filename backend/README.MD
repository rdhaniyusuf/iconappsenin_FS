# Project Setup

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project environment and install the required dependencies.

### 1. Setting Up the Environment

First, create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv env
```

Activate the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    .\env\Scripts\activate
    ```

### 2. Installing Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required packages using `req.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r req.txt
```

### 3. Deactivating the Environment

When you're done working on the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment with:

```bash
deactivate
```

## Additional Information

For more details on managing virtual environments and dependencies, refer to the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
